      If you want to reconnect with nature then Soca Valley is perfect for you!
      impressive waterfalls, deep gorges, high mountains, dizzying suspension
      bridges and the magnificent landscape are just a few highlights of a tour
      along the Soča River. But also active ones will get their money’s worth
      with activities like hiking, canyoning, kayaking, mountain biking,
      swimming and rafting.

      The entire valley runs along the Emerald Road, the world-famous turquoise
      Soča River. Especially the upper part of the Soča River is ideal for
      action-packed water sports. Rafting, kayaking and canyoning are
      particularly offered in the towns of Bovec, Kobarid and Tolmin. Activities
      such as hiking in the Triglav Mountains, mountain biking and cycling are
      also popular activities all over the valley.

    <p>
      you can visit the beautiful valley during every season. Whether spring,
      summer, autumn or winter, each season has its own treasures.
