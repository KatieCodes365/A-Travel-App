      While crowds of tourists fill Venice, Florence and Rome, Bologna remains
      relatively quiet in comparison. This mediaeval university town is
      charming, historic and fun to explore
    </p>
    <p>
      A marvellous medieval centre, piles of perfect pasta and a thriving
      university, which is Europe's oldest, dating from 1088. Bologna ticks all
      the boxes for a memorable stay combining good food with cultural
      curiosities. There are treasures to be discovered include a peppering of
      medieval towers, miles of porticoes and monumental statues with intriguing
      stories attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bologna is a painfully beautiful city that is easy to get around by foot
      or bike.
